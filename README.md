## DS-Starter-Editor
A tool to edit starters of the mainline DS Pokemon games. 
Current games supported: Platinum, HeartGold, SoulSilver, Black 2, White 2

**OnlyUS ROMs are supported**

This tool needs the project folder with the extracted contents of your ROM.
It can be generated by [DSPRE](https://github.com/AdAstra-LD/DS-Pokemon-Rom-Editor/releases/tag/v1.7.1) when you load a ROM for the first time, and it will be in the same folder of your ROM, named "ROMname_DSPRE_contents".
Once you've set up the project folder, launch the tool and select a game, then select the folder that has been created by DSPRE, make your edits and then click apply changes.
You can now save the ROM by DSPRE, remember to not re-extract the contents of your ROM.
