## DS-Starter-Editor
A tool to edit starters of the mainline DS Pokemon games. 
Current games supported: Platinum (starter sprites, cries), HeartGold/SoulSilver (only starter sprites)

**OnlyUS ROMs are supported**

# How to use 
1. If you haven't already, create project with [DSPRE](https://github.com/AdAstra-LD/DS-Pokemon-Rom-Editor/releases/tag/v1.7.1), this will generate a folder at the same location of your ROM containing the extracted data
2. Launch DS Starter Editor and choose the game
3. Select the project folder that was created by DSPRE
4. Edit your starters and then click apply changes
5. Close the tool, launch DSPRE and open your project, then you can save the ROM with the new starters. Remember to not re-extract the contents of the ROM!

- The tool does not edit text or the rival team, but both can be done in DSPRE anyway.
- Platinum starters will not have their sprites changed if they have a national dex number between 256 and 260 and are in the first slot, between 256 and 264 and are in the second slot, or between 256 and 268 and are in the third slot
